# JHelpViewer
Javadoc viewer, try to make something like Qt Assitant.

I wrote this project in 2008 to learn Java.
1) After launching app, you specify JavaDoc folder with \*.html files
2) App scans it and parses. Supported JavaDoc format can be outdated now.
3) App displays index window with functions, names, classes, enums etc.
4) App displays main central widget to show selected html page
5) supports tabs and navigation history
