Javadoc viewer, try to make something like Qt Assitant

I wrote this project something around 2008 to learn Java. I'm a C++ dev, but knowing Java is useful in many ways.
1) After launching app, you specify JavaDoc folder with *html files
2) app scans it and parses. Supported JavaDoc format can be outdated here.
3) Displays index window with functions, names, classes, enums etc.
4) Displays main central widget to show selected *html page
